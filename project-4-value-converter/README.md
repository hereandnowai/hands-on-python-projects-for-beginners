# Project-Based Python: A Beginner's Guide to Building a Value Converter

**Welcome!** In this lesson, we will learn the fundamentals of Python programming by building a versatile value converter. This application will handle temperature, currency, and length conversions, demonstrating how to interact with external services for real-time data.

## Part 1: The Converter's Brain (`value_converter.py`)

This file contains all the logic for performing our conversions.

#### 1. Importing Necessary Modules
*   **`import requests`**: This module is essential for making HTTP requests to fetch real-time data from web APIs, specifically for currency conversion.

#### 2. Defining Conversion Functions
Each type of conversion is encapsulated in its own function, making the code organized and reusable.

*   **`convert_celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_celsius)`**: Converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
*   **`convert_fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp_fahrenheit)`**: Converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
*   **`convert_currency_api(amount, from_currency, to_currency)`**: Fetches real-time exchange rates and performs currency conversion.
*   **`convert_cm_to_feet_inches(value_cm)`**: Converts centimeters to feet and inches.
*   **`convert_feet_inches_to_cm(feet, inches)`**: Converts feet and inches to centimeters.

#### 3. The Main Program Loop (Command-Line Interface)
The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block contains the command-line interface for the converter. This code runs only when `value_converter.py` is executed directly.

## Part 2: The User Interface (`value_converter_ui.py`)

This file provides a user-friendly graphical interface for the value converter using Gradio.

#### 1. Importing Necessary Modules
*   **`import gradio as gr`**: Imports the Gradio library for building the UI.
*   **`import json`, `import os`**: Used for handling branding data.
*   **`from value_converter import ...`**: Imports the conversion functions from `value_converter.py`.

#### 2. Branding Integration
The UI integrates branding elements (logo, slogan, colors, social media links) from your `branding.json` file.

#### 3. Gradio Interface Structure
The UI is built using `gr.Blocks` and organizes conversions into separate tabs for Temperature, Currency, and Length. Each tab has its own input fields, conversion button, and output display.

## How to Run

To run this value converter, you first need to install the required libraries. If you haven't already, you can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests gradio
```

### Command-Line Interface

To run the command-line version, execute `value_converter.py`:

```bash
python value_converter.py
```

### Graphical User Interface

To run the Gradio UI, execute `value_converter_ui.py`:

```bash
python value_converter_ui.py
```

This will launch a web server with the user interface. You can access it by opening the provided URL in your web browser.
