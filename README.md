## About The Repo

This repository serves as a practical guide for aspiring Python developers. Beyond just providing code, it demonstrates how to build functional applications and enhance them with modern web-based UIs, making the learning process more engaging and visually rewarding. You can also refer to our video on YouTube on this exact topic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

*   **VS Code**: A modern code editor.
*   **Python**: Version 3.10 or newer.
*   **Git**: For version control.
*   **GitHub Account**: To fork and clone the repository.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command installs `gradio` and all other necessary packages.

## Projects
Each project in this repository comes with:
*   A command-line interface (CLI) version, focusing on core Python logic.
*   A Gradio-based web user interface (UI) version, demonstrating modern application development.
