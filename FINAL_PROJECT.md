# Final Project: Build Your Own Python Application

Congratulations on completing the 10 Python projects! Now it's time to apply what you've learned to create your own application from scratch.

## Project Requirements

1.  **Create a Python Application:** Build a new application using the Python programming language.

2.  **Incorporate Learned Concepts:** Your project should utilize the concepts and techniques you've learned from the 10 hands-on projects. This includes fundamental programming logic, data handling, and user interface design.

3.  **Build a User Interface (UI):** Your application must have a user interface. You can use libraries like `tkinter`, `customtkinter`, `Gradio`, `Streamlit`, web frameworks like `Flask` or `Django`, or even frontend technologies like `React` or plain `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to build the UI.

4.  **Version Control with Git:** Create a new repository on your GitHub account for your project. Commit your code regularly with clear and descriptive messages.

5.  **Deploy on Hugging Face:** Deploy your application to Hugging Face Spaces. This will make your project publicly accessible and allow you to share it with others.

6.  **Presentation:** Prepare a short presentation and demo of your application. The presentation should not exceed 180 seconds (3 minutes). Showcase the features of your app and briefly explain the technologies you used.
