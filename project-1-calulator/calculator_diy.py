    # 1. Print a welcome message for the user.
    #    Example: "===== Welcome to HERE AND NOW AI's Calculator App =====\n"

    # 2. Start an infinite loop to keep the calculator running.
    #    HINT: A 'while True:' loop is a good choice here.

        # 3. Inside the loop, first, inform the user about the available options.
        #    Print something like: "Operators: +, -, *, / or exit"

        # 4. Get input from the user for the desired operator.
        #    Store it in a variable, for example, 'op'.

        # 5. Add a condition to check if the user wants to 'exit'.
        #    If so, 'break' the loop.

        # 6. Check if the operator is valid (i.e., one of '+', '-', '*', '/').
        #    If not, print an error message and 'continue' to the next iteration.

        # 7. Get the first and second numbers from the user.
        #    Remember to convert them to a numeric type, like float.
        #    HINT: Use float(input(...))

        # 8. Call the 'calculate' function with the numbers and operator.
        #    Store the returned value in a 'result' variable.

        # 9. Print the final result to the user.
        #    Example format: f"Output: {result}"
        pass # Remove this line and implement the steps above.
