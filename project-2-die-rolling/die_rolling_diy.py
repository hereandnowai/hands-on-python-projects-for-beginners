    # 4. Start an infinite loop to keep the simulator running.
    #    HINT: A 'while True:' loop is a good choice here.

        # 5. Inside the loop, ask the user if they want to roll the die.
        #    You can use input("Do you want to roll a die? (y/n): ")

        # 6. Check the user's input. If it's 'y' (or 'Y'), then:
        #    a. Print a message like "Rolling the die...".
        #    b. Call the `roll_die()` function to get a number.
        #    c. Print the result, for example: "The die shows: [number]".

        # 7. If the user's input is 'n' (or 'N'), then:
        #    a. Print an exit message like "Exiting...".
        #    b. Use the `break` keyword to exit the loop.

        # 8. If the input is anything else, print an error message.
        #    Example: "Invalid input. Please try again."
        pass # Remove this line and implement the steps above.
